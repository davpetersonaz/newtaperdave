source: Audio-Technica AT853 mics > 4.7k modified mini-xlr-to-headphone y-cable > 25' gold-plated stero-audio cable > ZoomH4n Handy Recorder external mic jack > Lexar Professional 633x 32gb 95-mb/s SD-HC-I card > audacity > you
location: mics taped inside hat, dead center about 15' from stage 
taper: davpeterson

taper notes: the y-cable has a short, so there are occasionally loud crackles when it got bumped, i tried to minimize them as much as i could.
taper notes: i know my track timings are off, but with the late start and the bathroom trip, i gave up trying to get it perfect.
