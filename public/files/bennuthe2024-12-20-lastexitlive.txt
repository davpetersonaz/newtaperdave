taper: davpeterson
taper notes: a mic cable was having issues during this set and the right channel was unusable, so this is basically a mono-recording.

Blending elements of psychedelic, progressive, and electronic rock with jazz sensibilities, infectious dance beats and group improvisation, The Bennu delivers dynamic live shows that are unique with each performance.
