location: mics taped inside hat, dead center about 15' from stage 
taper: davpeterson
taper notes: sound varies as i find my spot on the floor (mics were in my hat), i deleted some spots when friends are chatting with me.
taper notes: the y-cable has a short, so there are occasionally loud crackles when it got bumped, i tried to minimize them as much as i could.
